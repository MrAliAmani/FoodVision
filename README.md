# FoodVision
This project is an image classification done on Food101 dataset which consists of 101 different categories of foods.
I have used different deep learning and transfer learning models like EfficientNetB0 on this dataset along with different techniques like data augmentation to compare different models and achive the best results possible.
Finally the model has been evaluated and the top 100 most wrong predictions have been observed.
